# Class 01 Reading Notes

## Getting started with the web

Getting started with the web is a concise series introducing you to the practicalities of web development. You'll set up the tools you need to construct a simple webpage and publish your own simple code.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich. JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.

## What is HTML?

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way.

## Basic sections of a document

Webpages can and will look pretty different from one another, but they all tend to share similar standard components, unless the page is displaying a fullscreen video or game, is part of some kind of art project, or is just badly structured:
**header:**
Usually a big strip across the top with a big heading, logo, and perhaps a tagline. This usually stays the same from one webpage to another.
**navigation bar:**
Links to the site's main sections; usually represented by menu buttons, links, or tabs. 
**main content:**
A big area in the center that contains most of the unique content of a given webpage.
**sidebar:**
Some peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc. 
**footer:**
A strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or contact info. 

## What is the HTML head?

The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded. It contains information such as the page <title>, links to CSS (if you choose to style your HTML content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and other metadata (data about the HTML, such as the author, and important keywords that describe the document).
